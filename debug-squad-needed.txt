/**
 * Debug: What players does Football Data API have for Real Madrid?
 * Since we can't access the API key in plain Node.js, we'll create
 * an API endpoint to show this
 */

// This would need to be called via the Next.js dev server
// Let me create a test endpoint

console.log(`\nTo debug Football Data API squad data:
1. Create test endpoint in pages/api/debug-squad.ts
2. Call it to see Real Madrid's actual player list
3. Check if "Kylian Mbappé" or variations are present

For now, check the server logs when searching for "Real Madrid squad"
to see what players are returned.
